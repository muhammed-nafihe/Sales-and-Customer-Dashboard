Tableau Dashboards for Sales and Customer Analytics

This project involves the creation of two interactive dashboards using Tableau to analyze and visualize key metrics for both sales performance and customer behavior. The dashboards are designed to assist stakeholders such as sales managers, executives, and marketing teams in making data-driven decisions. The following outlines the purpose, requirements, and features of the dashboards.

Sales Dashboard

Purpose

The sales dashboard provides an overview of key sales metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to analyze year-over-year sales performance and understand sales trends.

Key Features
	1.	KPI Overview: Displays a summary of total sales, profits, and quantities for the current year and the previous year.
	2.	Sales Trends: Visualizes monthly data for each KPI across two years, highlighting the months with the highest and lowest sales.
	3.	Product Subcategory Comparison: Compares sales performance by product subcategories for both years, including sales and profit comparison.
	4.	Weekly Trends for Sales & Profit: Shows weekly sales and profit data for the current year, with the average weekly values highlighted and weeks above or below average clearly marked.

Customer Dashboard

Purpose

The customer dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer data, trends, and behaviors, aiding marketing teams and management in understanding customer segments and enhancing customer satisfaction.

Key Features
	1.	KPI Overview: Displays the total number of customers, total sales per customer, and total number of orders for both the current year and the previous year.
	2.	Customer Trends: Shows monthly data for each KPI, identifying the months with the highest and lowest sales.
	3.	Customer Distribution by Number of Orders: Represents customer behavior by the number of orders placed, providing insights into customer loyalty and engagement.
	4.	Top 10 Customers by Profit: Highlights the top 10 customers who have generated the highest profits for the company.

Design & Interactivity Requirements
	•	Dynamic Dashboards: Allows users to check historical data by selecting any desired year.
	•	Navigation: Provides easy navigation between the Sales and Customer dashboards.
	•	Interactive Charts and Graphs: Users can filter data interactively by product (category and subcategory) and location (region, state, and city).

These interactive features ensure that users can drill down into specific areas of interest for deeper insights.
